        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>
          We are a studio based in Jingan, Shanghai.
          We offer beginner to advanced courses in Aerial Yoga,
          as well as a range of contemporary mixed yoga classes.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Why are we different from others?</h3>
        <p>
          'XS' stands for 'Extra Small, Extra Strong'.
          We're not a large studio.
          Instead, we foster a family-like
          environment among the students and instructors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of having a gym-like 'work-out',
          we believe in <b>small, intimate</b> classes,
          focusing on <b>individualized attention
          and building skill level</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>
          We're progressive...
        </h4>
        <p>
          Like any other sport, yoga is a skill that becomes sweeter with <b>progress</b>.
          The range of moves that we execute increases with practice, and with
          that, comes a greater sense of fun and achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to have fun in our classes, and encourage our members
          to gain skill.
          Small classes aid us in doing so. With us, members have tried moves
          that surprised themselves!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our instructors regularly go for workshops to advance themselves,
          so that they may teach better and share their
          new learnings with students. As classes progress,
          we keep classes fresh with new moves and techniques.
        </p>
        <h3>Fell off the boat? Get on again.</h3>
        <p>
          Face it, if we could pay a membership fee to get the figure of a supermodel,
          we would gladly pay three times as much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of us have dropped in and out of yoga at some point in time. But fewer of us
          have made the step of committing sufficiently to feel a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The critical difference is in trying to build a lifelong habit. If you have dropped
          out, get back on! If you have already committed to regular practice,
          keep up the good work!
        </p>
        <p>
          This goes in line with the core of our motto - <b>metamorphosis</b>. To derive the full benefits of yoga,
          we believe that members should adjust to have <b>long-term</b> thinking,
          instead of a short-term fitness goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all feel better about ourselves when we try.
          Keep working on it, and give yourself the time to blossom!
          Have patience, and don't expect immediate results; after all, you're trying
          to develop a lifelong routine. Most importantly, don't stop!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a professional struggling to keep your fitness levels
          up as you develop your career, we understand you. Find a buddy, get a friend.
          Start today!
