                    Our Aerial Yoga, or <b>XS Yoga Anti-Gravity</b> is our speciality and passion. Aerial Yoga uses heavy-duty hammocks as an aid to complete yoga poses. It's all sorts of good for you, and most importantly, it's fun! Enthusiasts say that they feel like circus performers while doing it (almost).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our small class sizes allow the instructor to pay more attention to you, whether you're at a beginner, intermediate, or advanced level. So don't worry if you're just starting out -- we have professionals to take care of you, and we'll love to have you.
                </p>

                    While Aerial Yoga is fun, there are many other forms of yoga that our instructors are passionate over. We've picked our favorites to share with you.

                <p>
                    You will find that our smaller classes allow our instructors to take care of you, and help you complete some harder moves that you may have trouble finding the correct techniques for. Some of our popular classes, on request, include:
                    <br />
                    - <b>Inversions:</b> Find that sweet spot for headstands and difficult poses, that even regular yoga practitioners have difficulty mastering.
                    <br />
                    - <b>Yoga Core:</b> Train those abs! In a few weeks you'll stand straighter and look better.
                    <br />
                    - <b>Chest Opening:</b> Especially good for ladies. You'll find that deep stretches help with backaches and posture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our yoga classes are regularly updated to keep things fresh. Check back often!

                    Eager to get back in shape after pregnancy? Not feeling your best can be a frustrating experience, even with the joys of motherhood. It can be difficult to deal with all these changes in your body, on top of actually, you know, having a new baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our instructors understand. Our lead instructor for pre/post-natal yoga was not too long ago, an expecting mother. Our yoga classes help you develop your strength and stamina, tone your muscles, while also being a great de-stressor. You deserve to feel your best during and after your pregnancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prenatal workshops are personalized. Please contact us directly to learn more, and allow us to understand more about your condition. Note that prenatal workshops are not available for prenancies in the first trimester.
