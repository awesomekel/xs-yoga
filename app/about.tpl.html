        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>
          XS Yoga offers Aerial & Mixed Yoga classes in Shanghai, in Jingan Area.
          We believe in small, intimate classes, focusing on individualized attention
          and building skill level.
        </p>
        <h3>Why are we different from others?</h3>
        <p>
          'XS' stands for 'Extra Small, Extra Strong'.
          We're not a large studio.
          Instead, we foster a family-like
          environment among the students and instructors.
        </p>
        <h4>
          We're progressive...
        </h4>
        <p>
          The core of our belief is that yoga, like any other sport,
          is a skill that becomes sweeter with progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a gym-like environment where one just 'works out',
          we try to have fun in our classes, and most importantly, progress.

          We try to have fun with our classes and
          Like any other sport, yoga is a skill that becomes sweeter with progress.
          We believe in advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that yoga is a skill and requires progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our instructors regularly go for workshops to advance themselves, so that they may teach better and share their
          new learnings with students. As classes progress, we keep classes fresh with new moves and techniques.
